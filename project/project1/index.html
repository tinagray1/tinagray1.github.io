<h2>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration</h2>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>A knitted R Markdown document (ideally HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 10/11/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document).</p>
<p>The text of the document should provide a narrative structure around your code/output. All results presented must have corresponding code. Any answers/results/plots etc. given without the corresponding R code that generated the result will not be considered. Furthermore, all code contained in your final project document must work correctly (knit early, knit often)! Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. (Code that produces warnings is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean!)</p>
</div>
<div id="find-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Find data:</h3>
<p>Find two (!) datasets with one variable in common (e.g., dates, times, states, counties, countries, sports players), both with at least 50 observations (i.e., rows) in each. Please think very carefully about whether it makes sense to combine your datasets! If you find one dataset with 50 patients and it has their age, and you find another dataset with 50 <em>different</em> patients that has their ages, it makes no sense to join them based on age (you would just be pairing up random people of the same age).</p>
<p>When combined, the resulting/final dataset must have <strong>at least 4 different variables (at least 3 numeric) in addition to the common variable</strong> (i.e., five variables total).</p>
<p>You can have as many variables as you would like! If you found two datasets that you like but they don't have enough variables, find a third dataset with the same common variable and join all three.</p>

<p>I chose three datasets. The teeth dataset contains the percentage of seniors (65+) who have lost some of their teeth by state. The cigs dataset contains the percentage of adults who smoke and the sample size by state. The drugs dataset contains opioid overdose death rates and the number of deaths by state. I chose these datasets because I am interested in going to dental school in the future. Cigarettes and drug use are both known to damage the health of teeth, so I chose those datasets to compare to the teeth data to see if there was a correlation between the usage of those things and the health of the teeth of seniors by state. I think that states with higher tooth loss will also tend to have higher rates of smoking and drug overdose.</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If the datasets are not tidy, you will need to reshape them so that every observation has its own row and every variable its own column. If the datasets are both already tidy, you will make them untidy with <code>pivot_wider()/spread()</code> and then tidy them again with <code>pivot_longer/gather()</code> to demonstrate your use of the functions. It's fine to wait until you have your descriptives to use these functions (e.g., you might want to pivot_wider() to rearrange the data to make your descriptive statistics easier to look at); it's fine long as you use them at least once!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Depending on your datasets, it might be a good idea to do this before joining. For example, if you have a dataset you like with multiple measurements per year, but you want to join by year, you could average over your numeric variables to get means/year, do counts for your categoricals to get a counts/year, etc.</p></li>
<li>If your data sets are already tidy, demonstrate the use of <code>pivot_longer()/gather()</code> and <code>pivot_wider()/spread()</code> on all or part of your data at some point in this document (e.g., after you have generated summary statistics in part 3, make a table of them wide instead of long). Dataset was already tidy, so this will be done in part 3.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Join your 2+ separate data sources into a single dataset based on a common ID variable! If you can't find a good pair datasets to join, you may split one main dataset into two different datasets with a common ID variable in each, and then join them back together based on that common ID, but this is obviously less than ideal.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will document the type of join that you do (left/right/inner/full), including a discussion of how many observations were in each dataset, which observations in each dataset were dropped (if any) and why you chose this particular join.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>There were 53 observations in the cigs dataset and 50 observations in both the teeth and drugs data. I did a full join for teeth and drugs because they had data for each state and it would've given me the same result regardless of which type of join I did. I did a left join to join that data with the cigs data because the cigs data had a few extra observations that I wanted to exclude, since they weren't in the other datasets. The cases that were dropped out of the cigs dataset were data collected from the U.S territories and District of Columbia. Dropping those cases should not be an issue since only 3 cases were dropped.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create summary statistics</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use <em>all six</em> core <code>dplyr</code> functions (<code>filter, select, arrange, group_by, mutate, summarize</code>) to manipulate and explore your dataset. For mutate, create a new variable that is a function of at least one other variable, preferably using a dplyr vector function (see dplyr cheatsheet). It's totally fine to use the <code>_if</code>, <code>_at</code>, <code>_all</code> versions of mutate/summarize instead (indeed, it is encouraged if you have lots of variables)</p></li>
<li><p>Create summary statistics (<code>mean, sd, var, n, quantile, min, max, n_distinct, cor</code>, etc) for each of your numeric variables both overall and after grouping by one of your categorical variables (either together or one-at-a-time; if you have two categorical variables, try to include at least one statistic based on a grouping of two categorical variables simultaneously). If you do not have any categorical variables, create one using mutate (e.g., with <code>case_when</code> or <code>ifelse</code>) to satisfy the <code>group_by</code> requirements above. Ideally, you will find a way to show these summary statistics in an easy-to-read table (e.g., by reshaping). (You might explore the kable package for making pretty tables!) If you have lots of numeric variables (e.g., 10+), or your categorical variables have too many categories, just pick a few (either numeric variables or categories of a categorical variable) and summarize based on those. It would be a good idea to show a correlation matrix for your numeric variables (you will need it to make one of your plots).</p></li>

<p>The first thing I did was omit any NAs so that none of my summary statistics would be messed up. Then, I filtered the rows with more than 20% lost teeth and arranged them to see the states with the largest percentage of seniors who have lost teeth. After that, I used summarize if to find the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and number of distinct values for each column. Then, I mutated by data to add a new column, abuse.cat. abuse.cat sorts each state into categories &quot;high&quot;, &quot;med&quot;, and &quot;low&quot; based on the drug overdose rates. I used this new column and summarize to find drugs.n, which is the total number of overdoses in the sample. I grouped by the abuse category to calculate the mean of overdoses, smokers, and teeth lost. I used pivot longer and pivot wider to tidy the data up. The data wasn't really untidy in the first place sinse all of the statistics were means, but the names of each column are a little cleaner since they don't have &quot;mean_&quot; in front of them anymore. Instead, the mean is in its own column called function. First I used pivot_longer on the numeric columns, then I separated them by the name to separate the type of summary statistic (mean) and the data that the mean function was performed on. Afterwards, I used pivot_wider to make the overdoses, smokers, and teeth lost back into column names.</p>

    20, &quot;high smoke&quot;, ifelse(cig.use.rate &lt;= 20 &amp; cig.use.rate &lt;= 
    10, &quot;med smoke&quot;, &quot;low smoke&quot;)))
ggplot(fulldata, aes(x = abuse.cat, y = od.death.rate, fill = abuse.cat)) +

    scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Overdose Death Rate&quot;) + scale_x_discrete(&quot;Abuse Catergory&quot;) +

<p><img src="../../project/project1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> For the bar graphs, I mutated a new categorical column in my data called smoke.cat. smoke.cat is the same as abuse.cat, but instead of being based on drug overdose rates, it is based on cigarette smoking rates. I made this new column to facet wrap my bar graph (so that I could incorporate 3 variables) without having to facet wrap it by state. It would have been too overwhelming to do it by state and it would be really hard to read that way. These bar graphs show the overdose death rates for each abuse category, while being separated by high, medium, and low smoking rates.</p>

<p>For this code, I made a plot to figure out the number of clusters to use for PAM. 3 has the highest sil_width, so 3 is best choice for the number of clusters. I did PAM in this section of the code as well.</p>

<p><img src="../../project/project1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> I made eigenvectors for the data to do PCA. I made a matrix of the numeric data in my fulldataset and multiplied it with the eigenvectors. I made a plot to visualize my clusters, and colored them by the pam clusters.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(pam1, which = 2)</code></pre>
<img src="../../project/project1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> This plot shows that the average silhouette width is .14. Since the width is less than .25, no substantial structure has been found. This is supported by the plot above the silhouette wideth plot, where the clusters were all randomly scattered around the graph and did not appear to cluster anywhere.

<div id="where-do-i-find-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Where do I find data?</h3>
<p>OK, brace yourself!</p>
<p>You can choose ANY datasets you want that meet the above criteria for variables and observations. I'm just sitting here but off the top of my head, if you are into amusement parks, you could look at amusement-park variables, including ticket sales per day etc.; then you could join this by date in weather data. If you are interested in Game of Thrones, you could look at how the frequency of mentions of character names (plus other character variables) and the frequency of baby names in the USA...You could even take your old Biostats data and merge in new data (e.g., based on a Google forms timestamp).</p>
<p>You could engage in some &quot;me-search&quot;: You can <a href="https://support.spotify.com/ca-en/article/data-rights-and-privacy-settings/">request your Spotify data</a> or <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/101917">download Netflix viewing activity</a>, Amazon purchase history, etc. You can use your Google Fit/Fitbit/Apple watch data, etc. These can be combined (e.g., with each other, with other data sources).</p>
<p>You can make it as serious as you want, or not, but keep in mind that you will be incorporating this project into a portfolio webpage for your final in this course, so choose something that really reflects who you are, or something that you feel will advance you in the direction you hope to move career-wise, or something that you think is really neat. On the flip side, regardless of what you pick, you will be performing all the same tasks, so it doesn't end up being that big of a deal.</p>
<p>If you are totally clueless and have no direction at all, log into the server and type</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))</code></pre>
<p>This will print out a list of <strong>ALL datasets in ALL packages</strong> installed on the server (a ton)! Scroll until your eyes bleed! Actually, do not scroll that much... To start with something more manageable, just run the command on your own computer, or just run <code>data()</code> to bring up the datasets in your current environment. To read more about a dataset, do <code>?packagename::datasetname</code>.</p>
<p>If it is easier for you, and in case you don't have many packages installed, a list of R datasets from a few common packages (also downloadable in CSV format) is given at the following website: <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html" class="uri">https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html</a> (including types/numbers of variables in each)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A good package to download for fun/relevant data is <code>fivethiryeight</code>. Just run <code>install.packages(&quot;fivethirtyeight&quot;), load the packages with</code>library(fivethirtyeight)<code>, run</code>data()`, and then scroll down to view the datasets. Here is an online list of all 127 datasets (with links to the 538 articles). Lots of sports, politics, current events, etc: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>If you have already started to specialize (e.g., ecology, epidemiology) you might look at discipline-specific R packages (vegan, epi, respectively). We will be using some tools from these packages later in the course, but they come with lots of data too, which you can explore according to the directions above</p></li>
<li><p>However, you <em>emphatically DO NOT</em> have to use datasets available via R packages! In fact, I would much prefer it if you found the data from completely separate sources and brought them together (a much more realistic experience in the real world)! You can even reuse data from your SDS328M project, provided it shares a variable in common with other data which allows you to merge the two together (e.g., if you still had the timestamp, you could look up the weather that day: <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/" class="uri">https://www.wunderground.com/history/</a>). If you work in a research lab or have access to old data, you could potentially merge it with new data from your lab!</p></li>
